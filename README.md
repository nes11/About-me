# About me

### Read my [profile](https://github.com/nes11/About-me/blob/master/Agn%C3%A8sGaroux.profile.pdf).  
Learning by myself made me develop strategies to approach new skills: reading, experimenting, then seeking help from more experienced developers has proved an effective method. 

# Learning path
I use this repo to keep track of the skills I learn and the concepts I explore.
